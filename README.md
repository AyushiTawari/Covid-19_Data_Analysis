Unveiling the Patterns: Analyzing COVID-19 Data for Insights and Trends

We begin by understanding the structure and contents of the dataset.
We proceed by performing data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and format conversions. This step ensures the data is ready for analysis without biases or errors.
We use various visualizations to show the co-relation between total deaths, total cases and total recovery. The analysis is communicated effectively through visualizations such as charts, graphs, heatmaps, and dashboards.
